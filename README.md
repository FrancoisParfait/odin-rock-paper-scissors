TOP Project 3 - Rock Paper Scissors game

This is my first JavaScript project! I'm pretty excited to get going on it - honestly, so far the other Odin projects have been a bit boring. Not that they were easy, though. I really struggled on the landing page project in a few different areas. It's just not necessarily what I'm interested in terms of programming, I guess. I don't want to just lay out a webpage, or whatever. I know that that's a huge part of web dev, but I guess maybe I'm just not interested in web dev like I thought. It'll be nice to make something that actually DOES something - even though at first I'm just going to be running this in the console, without a GUI.

So far, I've been using these readme's as a way to catalog my thoughts before and after working on the project. I know that's not necessarily what I'll always be doing with projects I post on here, but right now while I'm in the learning phase I think it's a good idea.

With this project I definitely need to dedicate some time to actually planning it out, using pseudocode and such. I haven't had to do that yet with the webpages, simply since it's just laying things out, not using any sort of functions. With this, I'm going to be writing code that actually needs to run in a certain way, so some planning seems imperative to making this turn out right.

I'd like to be able to debug/problem solve on this all without looking at a user solution, too. Last time I did peek at one when I still had a couple issues with the page. I just felt so stuck that I couldn't handle it anymore, which is pretty antithetical to how a programmer should operate, haha. The core of all development, as far as I have learned, is problem solving. So if I can't learn to do that effectively, then I'm not a programmer.

Anyway, those are my thoughts going into it. Will update with a post-mortem once I finish!
