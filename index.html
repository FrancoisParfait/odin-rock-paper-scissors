// So, first off there's the computerPlay function, that will return a random result from rock, paper, or scissors.
// Psuedocode:
// 1. Declare a variable with 'Rock' 'Paper' and 'Scissors'
// 2. Determine a random result
// 3. return result
// (Check with console.log to make sure this is giving the expected output)

function computerPlay() {
    let rockPaperScissors = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors'];
    let computerChoice = rockPaperScissors[Math.floor(Math.random() * rockPaperScissors.length)];
    console.log(computerChoice);
}

// Now I need to make a function that plays a single round of the game with a constant player input, for now
// Pseudocode:
// 1. First, declare variables for playerSelction and computerSelection
// 2. Create a function that has playerSelection and computerSelection as the parameters (playerSelection case-insensitive)
// 3. 


function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) {

}
